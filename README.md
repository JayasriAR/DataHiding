# Data Hiding

Welcome to the Audio and Image Steganography project using the LSB (Least Significant Bit) algorithm. 
This project is designed to demonstrate the concept of hiding information within audio and image files by manipulating the least significant bits of their pixel or sample values.
Steganography is the art of concealing data within other data to protect sensitive information or for covert communication.

## Features

- **Image Steganography:** Embed secret text or data into image files.
- **Audio Steganography:** Hide information within audio files, such as WAV files.
- **Decoding:** Retrieve hidden information from steganographic files.
- **Security:** Protect sensitive information through data hiding.
- **User choice:** Selecting Image or Audio Steganography
